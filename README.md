<h1>UGA Nutrition</h1>
<hr />
<p>This is an attempt on creating an IOS application that represents the nutrition labels for all the foods available at the University of Georgia Dining Hall.</p>

<p>This project utilized Guthrie Armstrong's <em>Commons.py</em> python script to retrieve data for nutrition lables</p>

<p>Firebase can be easily configured to store data and authenticate users of this application.</p>

<p>If you would like to improve this application. Go ahead, by all means. Be sure to give credit to me as specified in the license.</p>
